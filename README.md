# Y1 - JavaScript @ Goldsmiths, UOL

A compilation of my Year 1 Programming Class at Goldsmiths, University of London. 
In this class I learned a basic foundation of JavaScript Objects, EventObjects, Event Handlers, Event Listeners, DOM manipulation and interactivity!
All projects are written in Vanilla JS.
